# Illustrator, XD, React, FramerX, Storybook

## Conceptual Workflow

This is conceptual workflow for designing User Interfaces and developing a prototype of the User Interface.

# User Interface Design

## Adobe Illustrator

Initally a design concept sketch can be designed with Design Software such as Adobe Illustrator.

Adobe Illustrator is vector based, so it is useful for designing an inital mockup for quick iterations.

### Deliverables

A file for the overal design.

Maybe start creating seperate files for each component.

## Adobe XD

After a design concept is created, we move the design over to Adobe XD, which is a design software tool similar to Adobe Illustrator.

The different between Illustrator and XD, is that XD is centered around User Interface Design.

So there are additional functionality that Illustrator does not have.

Primarily Component based design.

### Deliverables

File of the overal design.

Seperate files of each component.

### Components

Elements in Adobe XD can be grouped as components.

These design components are linked across the design, and increase the speed in which iterations can be done.

As well being the industry standard for MODULAR User Interface Elements.

# Prototype Development

## ReactJS & FramerX

For the development of the prototype for showcasing interactions that are difficult to portray using static image files.

As well as conceptual UIs that can only be visualized by creating a developed prototype with the functionality.


### ReactJS

ReactJS is a JavaScript Library, that is centered around User Interfaces. 

Primarily the way the application is structured makes it perfect for organizing the various components in an UI.

Using ReactJS a developed prototype can be created with the components based on the designs of the Adobe XD.

### FramerX

FramerX is a drag and drop tool for designing UIs along side ReactJS.

Using this product streamlines the process of developing the ReactJS components.

## Storybook

Storybook is a UI component dev environment.

This allows for each UI element and component to be isolated, which is a great tool for developing and showcasing the components individually.

Rather than showcasing the entire React Application.
