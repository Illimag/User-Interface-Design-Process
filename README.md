# User Interface Design Process

This particular case of User Interface Design Process is focused on the specifications:

- Web, Digital and Computerized Systems

- Interaction Design, particularly to increase usability across the Persona Spectrum and increase accessibility for the Persona Limitation Spectrum 

- Human-Computer Interaction, particularly for the use of improving approachability of complex machine systems by human operators

Mainly this centers around the following devices:

- Mobile Handheld Smartphone Devices

- Mobile Tablet Computer Devices

- Portable Personal Laptop Computers

- Personal Desktop Computers

- Monitors of Various Dimensions

- Wearable Smartwatch Computers

The interface is accessed via the following methods:

- Web Browsers

- Native/Hybrid Mobile Applications

- Web Applications

## User Interface Design Methodology

Information architecture and research is an important first step in designing an User Interface. 

Then the initial conceptualization based on a hypothesis driven design process, with user testing for the goal of designing an interface that is intuitive and user friendly. 

Several levels of fidelity of increasing complexity to move the designs towards wireframes and finalized mockups. 

For the prototype starting with conceptualizing the use case scenarios and creating storyboards, then moving into sketches and paper prototypes. 

An important step of this process is forward thinking of the development of the prototype. 

Because although a visual interpretation of a prototype can be accomplished using design tools, certain functionalities can not be approached without having a certain degree of technical skill to implement said functionality into a working prototype.

    For example when designing for a conceptual Domino's Pizza Application for the Visually Impaired from the Personas Limitation Spectrum, without being able to implement a hidden HTML element that can be read by Samsung's Voice Assistant it may not have been seen as a feasible possibility. 
    
    As well as if not understanding the underlining technology stack that the application is built with, one would not be able to see how to design the interaction.

As so for this case of an User Interface Design Process being able to develop the prototype is an essential part of the design process.

## Prototype Development Methodology

An User Interface prototype built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript will typically fit the specifications detailed in this particular case of User Interface Design and Development Process. 

Certain functionality can be implementable only by using a detailed approach to the Document Object Model. 

In other cases by staying aware of development patterns, frameworks, libraries, and limitations of web platforms will shape the designing phase of the User Interface before it reaches the development phase. 

Although this may put a strain to the creative extent that one may take the design of the User Interface, allowing the form to follow the function of the User Interface creates designs that are able to be realistically implemented. 

Further down the process of the digital product this helps the developers and the engineers create the actual product, even if it means discarding the source code of the User Interface prototype. 

This also means that designs can be incrementally improved starting from a base line of realistic expectations. 

As for the cases where the actual digital product is built with technology that is different than the ones listed here, the prototype can be more of a showcase in a particular implementation of the functionality. 

Because a developed prototype is the closest thing to the actual product, when doing user testing it is more effective than a prototype built with paper and/or static image files. 

    For example a Samsung Smartwatch Application Prototype can be built using HTML/CSS/JavaScipt Compiled with Tizen Studio. 
    
    Then the prototype can be added to the Samsung App Store to be downloaded onto a Samsung Smartwatch to be used for user testing. 
    
    This is vastly superior than user testing with paper prototypes of a Samsung Smartwatch Application.

## Notes

A balance of what is technically possible and what is best for the user must be reached for this process to be effective.
